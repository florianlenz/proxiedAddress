## Security

## Background
When using ethereum and the blockchain at all you often use a private key to access your account. 
In the case you lose your private key you lose your funds as well. 
Ethereum was ment to be a smart contract platform. 
So let's say you marry your partner and you both have the contract on the blockchain. 
In case you lose your private key you can't prove that you married your partener since you don't have access to the private key anymore. 
This repo contain's an approach on how to address this issue.
