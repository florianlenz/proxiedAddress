## Security
**This is currently alpha quality** use it at you own risk.

## Background
When using ethereum and the blockchain at all you often use a private key to access your account. 
In the case you lose your private key you lose your funds as well. 
Ethereum was ment to be a smart contract platform. 
So let's say you marry your partner and you both have the contract on the blockchain. 
In case you lose your private key you can't prove that you married your partener since you don't have access to the private key anymore. 
This repo contain's an approach on how to address this issue.

## Install
Deploy the contract `contracts/AddressProxy.sol` with the tool you prefere (e.g. remix and metamask). 

## Usage
You first need to deploy the `contracts/AddressProxy.sol`. 
The first address should be the address of the private key you use in your daily live.
The second address should be as secure as possible. You will always never need it (except to replace the current owner and the recovery address)

You are now ready to use the proxy address. 
For every state mutate interaction with smart contract's you need to get the [transaction data](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#contract-methods) by calling the `getData` method on web3 contract instance.
After you go the data, you just call the `exec` method of the address proxy with the address of the smart contract you want to interact with, and the data you got from the `getData` method. 

## API
Please have a look at `contracts/AddressProxy.sol` in order to figure out how to interact with this contract.
